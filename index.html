  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I enjoy <strong>hiking</strong> around the Pacific NorthWest with my husband, hanging out with our 3 adorable <strong>cats</strong>: Olive, Lupita, and Bonita,
     <strong>traveling</strong> when possible, drinking <strong>coffee</strong>, and doing <strong>home improvement projects</strong> and talking about said projects.</p>
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Here's a bit about <em>my</em> background</p>
  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>I have a B.S. degree in Environmental Studies with a minor in Geography from Portland State University. I have also taken a handful of
    Computer Science classes from Portland Community College. My interest in Computer Science and coding initially developed after talking
    GIS classes during my Environmental Studies undergrad.</p>
  <h3>Job Experience</h3>
  <p>I have been working since late August 2020 with a software team as the Software Support Specialist. This position has given me some
    exposure to the software development process.</p>
